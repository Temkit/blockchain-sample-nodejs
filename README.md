## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that is a record of transactions. this project is a sample coin project that I created to learn how to create a blockchain. the coin named scpcoin.
we can use the blockchain to store the transactions of the coin. with the blockchain we can verify the transactions. and implemented difficulty hashing to make the transactions more secure.
